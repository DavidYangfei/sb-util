# Purpose
This repo demonstrates a proof of concept for the .sb3 utility for Scratch. It is a naive Javascript implementation to illustrate the different ways a project.json can be queried to get insightful information about a Scratch project.

# Documentation
In depth documentation of the sbutil API can be found on Google Drive: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mL5r9CZH3Ru-vfs7T-8c53PO59IT2a7NpiIt3t24fMw](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mL5r9CZH3Ru-vfs7T-8c53PO59IT2a7NpiIt3t24fMw)
